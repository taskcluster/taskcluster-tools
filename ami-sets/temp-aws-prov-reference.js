The provisioner maintains a set of worker configurations which\ncan be managed with an API that is typically available at\naws-provisioner.taskcluster.net/v1.  This API can also perform basic instance\nmanagement tasks in addition to maintaining the internal state of worker type\nconfiguration information.\n\nThe Provisioner runs at a configurable interval.  Each iteration of the\nprovisioner fetches a current copy the state that the AWS EC2 api reports.  In\neach iteration, we ask the Queue how many tasks are pending for that worker\ntype.  Based on the number of tasks pending and the scaling ratio, we may\nsubmit requests for new instances.  We use pricing information, capacity and\nutility factor information to decide which instance type in which region would\nbe the optimal configuration.\n\nEach EC2 instance type will declare a capacity and utility factor.  Capacity is\nthe number of tasks that a given machine is capable of running concurrently.\nUtility factor is a relative measure of performance between two instance types.\nWe multiply the utility factor by the spot price to compare instance types and\nregions when making the bidding choices.\n\nWhen a new EC2 instance is instantiated, its user data contains a token in\n`securityToken` that can be used with the `getSecret` method to retrieve\nthe worker's credentials and any needed passwords or other restricted\ninformation.  The worker is responsible for deleting the secret after\nretrieving it, to prevent dissemination of the secret to other proceses\nwhich can read the instance user data.\n","baseUrl":"https://aws-provisioner.taskcluster.net/v1","entries":[{"type":"function","method":"get","route":"/list-worker-type-summaries","query":[],"args":[],"name":"listWorkerTypeSummaries","stability":"stable","title":"List worker types with details","description":"Return a list of worker types, including some summary information about\ncurrent capacity for each.

There is no way to\nconfigure different regions to have different sets of instance types\nso ensure that all instance types are available in all regions.\nThis function is idempotent.\n\nOnce a worker type is in the provisioner, a back ground process will\nbegin creating instances for it based on its capacity bounds and its\npending task count from the Queue.
